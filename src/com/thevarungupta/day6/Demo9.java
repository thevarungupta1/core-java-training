/**
 * Lock
 * Synchronization is built around an internal entity know as lock or monitor
 * Every object has a lock associated with it
 * every thread that need consistency access to a object has to acquire lock before accessing them and
 * then release the lock when its done
 *
 * # Deadlock in java
 * It a part of multithreading
 * Deadlock can occur iun a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, that is acquired by another thread
 * and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread
 * since both thread are waiting for each other to release the lock this condition is called deadlock
